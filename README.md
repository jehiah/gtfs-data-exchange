Notice: GTFS Data Exchange Shutting Down

http://www.gtfs-data-exchange.com/

I started GTFS Data Exchange in 2008 to encourage adoption of the GTFS specification when barely a dozen transit agencies were sharing schedule data. Since then, much has changed as there are over a thousand agencies from almost every country around the world sharing GTFS data. Thus, the time has dome to close the chapter on GTFS-Data-Exchange.

What's next for the Transit Community? 

<https://transit.land/> has steadily been growing as the reference spot for worldwide GTFS data, and the spot for transit agencies to connect with developers. It is also built to expose schedule data from a single consistent database which makes it even easier for developers to access schedule information. Most importantly though, Transitland has a sponsor, [Mapzen](https://mapzen.com/), so developers can rely on it where gtfs-data-exchange has always been a side project, and more often than not in recent years, neglected.

Timeline for shutting down GTFS Data Exchange:

April 1, 2016 - Feed registry and manual uploads disabled
